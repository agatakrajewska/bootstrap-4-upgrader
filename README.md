# bootstrap-4-upgrader
Simple command line tool for upgrading bootstrap 3 to bootstrap 4. 
Basically runs a bunch replace regular expressions on html and scss files from the current location. 

Will need to run npm link to get it running as outlined in the following article. http://javascriptplayground.com/blog/2015/03/node-command-line-tool/

This will allow you to run from your project location and edit the index.js if there are any changes that are needed specific to your project.
